In today's digital landscape, user authentication is ubiquitous across websites. TechForum aims to provide a seamless and secure authentication experience tailored for the tech community. The motivation behind this project was to delve into the complexities of developing a custom API. Whether it's exploring the latest gadgets, diving into emerging technologies, or sharing coding tips and tricks, TechForum offers a dynamic space for tech enthusiasts to connect, comment, and collaborate. This project provided an opportunity to gain extensive knowledge in integrating front-end and back-end components seamlessly. It also introduced innovative tools like Handlebars, enriching my skill set and enabling the development of dynamic and responsive web applications. Additionally, I applied CSS knowledge to give the website a modern style.
